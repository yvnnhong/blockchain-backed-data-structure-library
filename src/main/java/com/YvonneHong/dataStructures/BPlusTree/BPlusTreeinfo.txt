BPlusTree info 
1. data is stored only in leaf nodes (in B-trees, data is stored at every level)
2. leaf nodes are linked in a doubly linked list (B-tree does not have this property)
3. search involves only internal nodes, data found at leaf nodes 
4. more efficient due to linked leaf nodes 
5. typically shorter (compared to b-trees) because only keys are stored in internal nodes 
6. more efficient than b-trees due to storage structure
