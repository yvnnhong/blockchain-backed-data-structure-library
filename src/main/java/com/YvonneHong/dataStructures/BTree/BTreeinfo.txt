Rules for B-Trees 
1. Nodes can be half-full to completely full (in terms of the number of keys a node has)
1.1 Essentially, the minimum number of keys in a node has to be the maximum possible number 
of nodes in a key, divided by 2
2. The number of child nodes in a non-leaf node is always one more than its number of keys 
3. The root node is the only node that is allowed to have less than maxKeys/2 children
4.
