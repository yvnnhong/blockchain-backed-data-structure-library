    //check if the new push worked ? 
    //maybe i should add a binary search tree (bst) ? 

    //The AVL tree is a self-balancing binary search tree (BST), which means that 
    //the nodes must follow the binary search tree property, where for any given node:

    //1) All nodes in the left subtree of a node are less than the node.
    //2) All nodes in the right subtree of a node are greater than the node.

    //methods/operations to add: 
    // 1) insertion
    // 2) deletion 
    // 3) lookup (searching)
    // 4) find max value 
    // 5) find min value 
    // 6) inorder traversal (print out all the nodes)
    // 7) preorder traversal (print out all the nodes)
    // 8) return height of tree / height calculation
    // 9) balance factor calculation
    // 10) delete min value 
    // 11) delete max value
    // 12) clone the tree 
    // 13) find successor of a node: The successor of a node is the node with the smallest key greater than the given node's key.
    // 14) find predecessor: The predecessor of a node is the node with the largest key smaller than the given node's key.

    //Helper methods: 
    //1) right rotation (single rotation)
    //2) left rotation (single rotation)
    //3) left-right rotation (double rotation)
    //4)right-left rotation (double rotation)
    //misc: left rotate, right rotate (necessary for node insertion)
