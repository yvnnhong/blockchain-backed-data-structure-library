In Java, the static keyword is used to define class-level members (variables or methods) 
that belong to the class itself rather than to instances of the class (objects).
This means that you can access static members without creating an instance of the class. 
Example usage: className.methodName(params); 
More specifically: we are allowed to use the methods defined in AVLTreeHelperMethods.java in 
AVLTree.java, as long as we call the method like this: AVLTreeHelperMethods.methodName(params); 
Note that, due to the static invocation, we do not need to create an instance of the AVLTreeHelperMethods
class in order to use a method in it.
